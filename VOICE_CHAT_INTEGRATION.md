- **Mute/Unmute**: Quick mute toggle during calls
- **Real-time Voice Level Indicators**: Visual feedback for speaking status
- **Microphone Access Management**: Proper permission handling

### ðŸ“Š Voice Level Monitoring
- **Local Voice Level**: Shows your own speaking volume and status
- **Remote Voice Level**: Shows other participants' speaking status
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded bars showing voice activity
- **Real-time Updates**: Live voice data synchronization

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- **WebRTC Audio Processing**: High-quality audio capture and processing
- **Socket.IO Integration**: Real-time voice data transmission
- **Audio Context Management**: Proper audio context lifecycle
- **Echo Cancellation**: Built-in noise suppression and echo cancellation

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

#### `useVoiceChat` Hook (`src/hooks/use-voice-chat.ts`)
The main hook that manages voice chat functionality:

```typescript
const {
  voiceState,
  remoteVoiceData,
  enableVoiceChat,
  disableVoiceChat,
  toggleMute
} = useVoiceChat(recipientId, currentUserId, callbacks);
```

**Key Features:**
- Audio context initialization
- Microphone access management
- Real-time voice level monitoring
- Socket.IO voice data transmission
- Proper cleanup on unmount

#### Updated Persona3DVideoCall Component
Enhanced with voice chat controls and indicators:

- **Voice Chat Controls**: Enable/disable and mute buttons
- **Voice Level Indicators**: Real-time visual feedback
- **Status Panel**: Comprehensive voice chat status information
- **Integration with Avatar Data**: Voice levels affect avatar animations

### Backend Integration

#### Voice Data Handling (`server/modern-server.js`)
The server already includes proper voice data handling:

```javascript
socket.on('voiceData', (data) => {
  // Broadcast voice data to all connected users except sender
  activeSockets.forEach((clientSocket, socketId) => {
    if (socketId !== socket.id) {
      clientSocket.emit('voiceData', {
        userId: data.userId,
        recipientId: data.recipientId,
        volume: data.volume,
        isSpeaking: data.isSpeaking,
        timestamp: data.timestamp
      });
    }
  });
});
```

## Usage

### Starting a Voice Chat Session

1. **Initiate Persona3D Video Call**: Use the existing video call functionality
2. **Enable Voice Chat**: Click the "Enable Voice Chat" button in the call interface
3. **Grant Permissions**: Allow microphone access when prompted
4. **Start Speaking**: Voice levels will be displayed in real-time

### Voice Chat Controls

- **Enable Voice Chat**: Green button to start voice chat
- **Mute/Unmute**: Toggle microphone on/off during call
- **Disable Voice Chat**: Red button to stop voice chat completely

### Voice Level Indicators

- **Green Bar**: Your voice level when speaking
- **Blue Bar**: Remote participant's voice level
- **Gray Bar**: No voice activity
- **Real-time Updates**: Bars update continuously during conversation

## Testing

### Voice Chat Test Page
A dedicated test page is available at `/voice-chat-test` to verify voice chat functionality:

- **Local Voice Testing**: Test microphone access and voice level detection
- **Remote Voice Testing**: Test voice data transmission between clients
- **Debug Information**: Detailed voice state and data logging
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time voice level indicators

### Test Instructions

1. Open the voice chat test page in your browser
2. Click "Enable Voice Chat" and grant microphone permissions
3. Speak into your microphone to see volume levels
4. Open the same page in another browser tab/window
5. Test voice data transmission between the two instances
6. Check browser console for detailed logs

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Support
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support with WebRTC
- **Firefox**: Full support with WebRTC
- **Safari**: Full support with WebRTC
- **Mobile Browsers**: Supported on modern mobile browsers

### HTTPS Requirement
Voice chat requires HTTPS for microphone access:
- **Development**: Use `https://localhost:3443` or `https://localhost:9443`
- **Production**: Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured

### Permissions
- **Microphone Access**: Required for voice chat functionality
- **User Consent**: Users must explicitly grant microphone permissions

## Integration with Avatar System

The voice chat system integrates seamlessly with the existing 3D avatar system:

- **Audio Level Data**: Voice levels are passed to avatar animations
- **Mouth Movement**: Voice data can drive avatar mouth movements
- **Real-time Sync**: Voice and avatar data are synchronized in real-time
- **Visual Feedback**: Voice activity is reflected in avatar expressions

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Microphone Permission Denied**
   - Solution: Refresh page and grant permissions when prompted
   - Check browser settings for microphone access

2. **No Voice Data Received**
   - Solution: Verify socket connection is active
   - Check network connectivity and server status

3. **Audio Context Issues**
   - Solution: Ensure user interaction before enabling voice chat
   - Some browsers require user gesture to initialize audio context

4. **HTTPS Required**
   - Solution: Use HTTPS URLs for voice chat functionality
   - Generate SSL certificates for local development

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Audio Quality Settings**: Adjustable audio quality and bitrate
- **Noise Suppression**: Advanced noise filtering options
- **Voice Effects**: Real-time voice modification effects
- **Recording**: Call recording functionality
- **Multiple Participants**: Support for group voice calls

### Performance Optimizations
- **Audio Compression**: Reduce bandwidth usage
- **Adaptive Quality**: Adjust quality based on network conditions
- **Efficient Processing**: Optimize audio processing algorithms

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Information
The voice chat system provides comprehensive debug information:

- **Voice State**: Current voice chat status and settings
- **Remote Data**: Received voice data from other participants
- **Socket Status**: Connection status and data transmission
- **Audio Levels**: Real-time volume and speaking detection

### Console Logging
Enable detailed logging by checking browser console:
- Voice data transmission logs
- Audio context initialization logs
- Socket connection status logs
- Error messages and warnings

## Security Considerations

- **Microphone Access**: Only granted with explicit user consent
- **Data Transmission**: Voice data is transmitted securely via Socket.IO
- **Privacy**: No voice data is stored or recorded
- **HTTPS**: All voice chat functionality requires secure connections
